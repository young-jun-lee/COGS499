Projects include a phase of self-directed problem definition and project scope definition in the fall term, followed by project execution in the winter term. Typical projects involve evaluation of technical alternatives (with an emphasis on health, safety, and environmental), preparation of detailed recommendations, and both market and financial analysis. Project topics vary widely and are provided by a diverse list of fee paying clients. The course includes seminars on project management. There are several meetings during the fall term to organize groups and select projects, but regularly scheduled lectures do not begin until the Winter term. Teams interact regularly with clients at both a technical and a management level, and are also assigned an industrial project mentor. Students master project management skills, by managing their own budget, travel arrangements etc. The course concludes with a comprehensive report and presentation to the client.

Curiosity of the world around us is emphasized for identifying opportunities to have an impact and make a difference, to which a discipline is imposed - one that identifies who might be interested in or benefit from our product or service, and how we can bring an idea to fruition and bring the necessary resources (e.g., financial, intellectual) to provide it to society. Legal aspects (e.g., incorporation, partnerships), raising capital, and protecting the strategic advantage of intellectual property (e.g., patents, trade secrets) are discussed, together with the importance of having a social acceptance to operate. The concept of a business model, summarized using the business model canvas methodology, is presented, together with the concept of a business plan describing how a venture will be operated over a time horizon. For-profit and not-for-profit ventures, and the elements of the business models for each, are studied and compared, and intrapreneurship/entrepreneurship are compared. Financial metrics for assessing the viability of ventures and guiding investment decisions are reviewed. Systems Thinking (recognizing the whole/parts and that which is common/distinct) is introduced. Design Thinking - a human-centered design emphasizing observation and insight - is presented, along with journey maps and personas for understanding customer segments. Diffusion of innovations is described, including the factors influencing adoption of innovations, and the manner in which innovations propagate in society.

These data are very difficult to be analyzed with classical statistical techniques due to the large number of variables and the interrelated nature among these variables. Multivariate statistical methods are employed for the analysis of these data in a wide spectrum of sciences such as Business Economics, Sociology, Chemical Engineering, Biology, and Medicine among others. The course will cover topics of basic Multivariate Analysis such as multivariate mean and variance analysis, T-Hotelling, Multinormal and Wishart distributions, and multivariate linear regression. Emphasis will be given in two advanced multivariate methods: Principal Component Analysis and Partial Least Squares. PCA and PLS are considered among the best statistical methods to analyze multivariate data and extract the information that is contained in them. In depth analysis of these techniques will be provided both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The aim of the course is to provide the statistical depth and understanding of these multivariate techniques for their successful application in data analysis, and their extension in the areas of Process Monitoring, Product Development, and Image Analysis. Participants need to have knowledge of basic statistics (probability, hypothesis testing) and matrix algebra and are encouraged to bring their own data sets. This is the best way for participants to relate the new statistical techniques into their own work experience. Three term-hours; P. Nomikos",

Capabilities now exist to synthesize materials with grains where one or more dimension is on the nanoscale (less than 100 nm). As the grain size decreases, there is a significant increase in the volume fraction of grain boundaries or interfaces. This characteristic strongly influences the chemical and physical properties of the materials. For example, nanostructured ceramics are tougher and stronger than coarser grained ceramics, while nanostructured metals exhibit increases in yield strength and elastic modulus. It has also been shown that other properties (e.g. electrical, optical and magnetic) are influenced by a fine grain structure. The goal of this course is to introduce the student to the impact of length scale, from millimeter to nanometer, on material properties, with a primary but not exclusive focus on mechanical properties.

We analyze standard derivative (futures, forwards, FRA's, swaps, stock options) as well as more recent ones such as exotic options and credit derivatives. We explore best practices in the area of market and credit risk management and address topical issues pertaining to the use of derivatives, including capital requirements for regulated financial institutions and strategic issues associated with corporate risk management. This course is designed for students aiming to pursue a career in investment banking, consulting, or in the non-finance corporate sector.",

Students will study how the strategic management of people supports the execution of strategy and the overall success of an organization. We will examine organization design and culture, factors influencing attraction, engagement, and retention of talent, as well as the evidence, techniques, and best practices for human capital development and management in an organization. We review some strategic organization decisions and their effects on the workforce, including outsourcing, restructuring, and merger and acquisition activities. Underlying these topics are the following themes set in a context of change and transformation of organizations: evidence-informed, ethical decision-making; the evaluation of HR alternatives and decisions; the impacts of decisions on people in organizations. This course will be applicable for those interested in careers in human capital or management consulting, organization development, and human resources, as well as those interested in understanding the strategic management of people in organizations more broadly.",

In its role as liaison or conduit to the customer, marketing makes promises which the rest of the organization has to keep. Promise too little and we fail to make a sale; promise too much and the result is a loss of customer loyalty and soft prices. But if marketing is to be an agent of strategy then it must recognize that businesses following different strategies require different kinds of marketing efforts and different supporting marketing infrastructures and approaches. Similarly, just as businesses change their strategies at different stages of their lifecycle and in response to market and competitive dynamics, so too must marketing make the appropriate accommodations to maintain its compatibility with the business' overall direction. This course provides a review of the major business strategies available to a firm, the identification of how marketing varies across businesses following different strategies, and how both business and marketing strategies must be adjusted over time in response to customer and competitive dynamics. Readings and a small number of case studies will be used. The final project is a real time exercise, dealing with a strategic problem facing a business presented to the senior management team of the enterprise.",

Typical projects result in changes such as improving productivity, enhancing morale, reducing expenses, boosting cash flows, augmenting Internet and e-marketing resources, implementing marketing research, increasing client retention, strengthening brand awareness for the organization or its products and services. There are no formal classes but consulting firm meetings to discuss client progress, methodological challenges and to review and rehearse client presentations and decisions regarding key client deliverables. While the methodologies and final deliverables are reviewed for quality purposes by the professor, the final deliverables are the responsibility of the consultants and are independently developed. Once selected for the course the students sign a contact outlining duties as well as personal learning and experiential objectives. The student will be evaluated by the professor on the same basis as a member of a professional services firm. Key performance attributes include technical skills such as analytical, writing and presentation skills as well as administration and project management effectiveness. Soft skills evaluated include engagement and contribution to the firm, leadership, team effectiveness/collaboration, professionalism and client relationships. Considerable emphasis is placed on the success of the client engagement as assessed by the professor through a formal client feedback and client satisfaction survey. Since this independent study is both project-and-client based, it is very rewarding, but demanding. Students will apply and improve skills related to delivery and management of professional services, and the integration of virtually all subject matter from previous courses. Students considering a career in consulting or professional service, with previous experience in managing projects, who enjoy interacting with business people, who thrive in fluid and ever-changing project cultures, who value the importance of fostering innovative or creative environments, are strongly encouraged to apply.\nAdmission to the course is by application and interview. Third and fourth year students may apply for the course in either the fall or winter term. While there are no formal course prerequisites, many projects do focus on issues such as consumer and promotional plans. Students should be interested in integrating skills, tools and concepts from numerous courses, and want a course where they apply themselves in the real-world management challenges.",
