Curiosity of the world around us is emphasized for identifying opportunities to have an impact and make a difference, to which a discipline is imposed - one that identifies who might be interested in or benefit from our product or service, and how we can bring an idea to fruition and provide the necessary resources (e.g., financial, intellectual) to provide it to society. Legal aspects (e.g., incorporation, partnerships), raising capital, and protecting the strategic advantage of intellectual property (e.g., patents, trade secrets) are discussed, together with the importance of having a social license to operate. The concept of a business model, summarized using the business model canvas methodology, is presented, together with the concept of a business plan describing how a venture will be operated over a time horizon. For-profit and not-for-profit ventures, and the elements of the business models for each, are studied and compared. Financial metrics for assessing the viability of ventures and guiding investment decisions are presented (e.g., IRR, NPV, EBITDA). Systems Thinking (recognizing the whole/parts and that which is common/distinct) is introduced. Design Thinking - a human-centered design emphasizing observation and experimentation gaining traction in engineering, business and social sciences - is presented. Working in groups, students identify a venture opportunity having a technological component, and propose a business model and plan as the major evaluation in the course.\nCOURSE DELETED 2018-2019\n(Lec: 3, Lab: 0, Tut: 0.5)",

Legal aspects (e.g., incorporation, partnerships), raising capital, and protecting the strategic advantage of intellectual property (e.g., patents, trade secrets) are discussed, together with the importance of having a social acceptance to operate. The concept of a business model, summarized using the business model canvas methodology, is presented, together with the concept of a business plan describing how a venture will be operated over a time horizon. For-profit and not-for-profit ventures, and the elements of the business models for each, are studied and compared, and intrapreneurship/entrepreneurship are compared. Financial metrics for assessing the viability of ventures and guiding investment decisions are reviewed. Systems Thinking (recognizing the whole/parts and that which is common/distinct) is introduced. Design Thinking - a human-centered design emphasizing observation and insight - is presented, along with journey maps and personas for understanding customer segments. Diffusion of innovations is described, including the factors influencing adoption of innovations, and the manner in which innovations propagate in society. Working in groups, students identify a venture opportunity having a technological component, and propose a business model and plan as the major evaluation in the course.\nK3.5(Lec: Yes, Lab: No, Tut: Yes)",

These data are very difficult to be analyzed with classical statistical techniques due to the large number of variables and the interrelated nature among these variables. Multivariate statistical methods are employed for the analysis of these data in a wide spectrum of sciences such as Business Economics, Sociology, Chemical Engineering, Biology, and Medicine among others. The course will cover topics of basic Multivariate Analysis such as multivariate mean and variance analysis, T-Hotelling, Multinormal and Wishart distributions, and multivariate linear regression. Emphasis will be given in two advanced multivariate methods: Principal Component Analysis and Partial Least Squares. PCA and PLS are considered among the best statistical methods to analyze multivariate data and extract the information that is contained in them. In depth analysis of these techniques will be provided both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The aim of the course is to provide the statistical depth and understanding of these multivariate techniques for their successful application in data analysis, and their extension in the areas of Process Monitoring, Product Development, and Image Analysis. Participants need to have knowledge of basic statistics (probability, hypothesis testing) and matrix algebra and are encouraged to bring their own data sets.

Capabilities now exist to synthesize materials with grains where one or more dimension is on the nanoscale (less than 100 nm). As the grain size decreases, there is a significant increase in the volume fraction of grain boundaries or interfaces. This characteristic strongly influences the chemical and physical properties of the materials. For example, nanostructured ceramics are tougher and stronger than coarser grained ceramics, while nanostructured metals exhibit increases in yield strength and elastic modulus. It has also been shown that other properties (e.g. electrical, optical and magnetic) are influenced by a fine grain structure. The goal of this course is to introduce the student to the impact of length scale, from millimeter to nanometer, on material properties, with a primary but not exclusive focus on mechanical properties. It will include discussions on synethesis approaches as well as examples of applications.\n(Lec: 3, Lab: 0, Tut: 0.5)",

In addition to the high temperatures and stresses to which materials are subjected in conventional applications, nuclear materials are subjected to various kinds of radiation which affect their performance, and often this dictates a requirement for a unique property (for example, a low cross section for thermal neutron absorption) that is not relevant in conventional applications. The effects of the radiation may be direct (e.g., the displacement of atoms form their normal positions by fast neutrons or fission fragments), or indirect (e.g., a more aggressive chemical environment caused by radiolytic decomposition). This course describes materials and structures typically used in nuclear environments, their manufacture, the unique conditions to which they are subjected, the basic physical phenomena that affect their performance and the resulting design and operational requirements for reactor components.

The course is conducted over two terms. In addition to the design, build and testing of a mechatronics or robotics system, each team is required to demonstrate communication, teamwork, and management skills at a professional level by preparing a formal design proposal, which includes a management plan, providing regular progress reports, and submitting a final design report, together with a formal presentation on the project and its results. Top-placed teams in a preliminary internal design competition will be sponsored to represent Queen's University at an external design competition.\n(Lec: 2, Lab: 6, Tut: 0)",

The first theme will introduce students to the spectrum of different types of private equity firms from institutional investors to dedicated specialist firms. The focus will be on developing a familiarity with the types of transactions considered by private equity funds, how to structure them and measure the value added to the portfolio firm. This part will take students through the stages of PE investments from finding a target, to due diligence, deal pricing and structuring, ownership, preparation for exit and exit. The second theme will address the unique challenges currently facing these funds, including measuring private equity fund performance, and how private equity funds realize their returns through distributions and exit.\nThe course will be applied in nature and focus on specific cases. Cases will be the main teaching tool, with lectures and guest speakers to provide economic fundamentals and institutional context. Approximately 50% of the cases will be developed internally with Smith Alumni at a large Private Equity firm who will provide funding for course development and detailed data on specific transactions in their portfolio. The Private Equity firm will also provide access to the individuals who worked on the transactions for supporting material in the form of video interviews of the main participants.",

Because business professionals are intimately involved with the business units, business processes, and customers, they are in a unique position to deliver highly customized applications that match their unique organizational needs. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of systems thinking and coding in order to be able to rapidly build and deploy customer- and employee-centric apps.\nThe course teaches students how to build digital solutions using a combination of tools including no code (e.g., data analytics in Excel), low code (e.g., visual app development platforms such as Salesforce), and code (e.g., JavaScript, Python). The course topics include computational thinking programming tools, communicating with business applications (API and Webservices), solving business problems with programming, and coding for an agile business.\nThis course has an applied focus. It uses business cases as a way to motivate logical thinking and the use of coding to solve business problems. In addition, the course leverages cloud services and lab environments to enable students to use state-of-the-art coding tools and resources.",

This is particularly important because the global economic system has undergone tremendous stress over the past three years. This course explores how the global economy works via the in-depth examination of the various \"systems\" that govern it - the systems of energy, finance, trade, and government-business relations.\nThe course develops frameworks, tools, and concepts from various disciplines - business strategy, economics, political science, philosophy - that will help new managers meet the non-market challenges they will inevitably face. It is heavily case and discussion based and looks at the practical application of the concepts discussed.

But if marketing is to be an agent of strategy then it must recognize that businesses following different strategies require different kinds of marketing efforts and different supporting marketing infrastructures and approaches. Similarly, just as businesses change their strategies at different stages of their lifecycle and in response to market and competitive dynamics, so too must marketing make the appropriate accommodations to maintain its compatibility with the business' overall direction. This course provides a review of the major business strategies available to a firm, the identification of how marketing varies across businesses following different strategies, and how both business and marketing strategies must be adjusted over time in response to customer and competitive dynamics. Readings and a small number of case studies will be used.

Whether it is the opportunities of selling to vast and growing markets-the so called \"fortune at the bottom of the pyramid\"-or the prospects of dramatically lower costs through outsourcing, business leaders are interested in developing country markets as never before. This broad-ranging course aims to apply the tools of economics and international business to understand the opportunities and pitfalls of doing business in developing-country environments. The course will focus on a range of practical business-focused questions, but it will also bring students to the frontier of debates in development economics and business ethics. Topics include: Assessing opportunities and challenges in emerging markets; building capabilities for doing business in weak institutional environments; debates among leading schools of thought on development; and the roles and responsibilities of profit-seeking businesses. The course should be of interest to students interested in development economics, international business and business ethics.\nNOTE: This course counts as credit towards the Certificate in Social Impact.",

        "description": "The course is organized and managed to duplicate a professional services firm. Typical projects result in changes such as improving productivity, enhancing morale, reducing expenses, boosting cash flows, augmenting Internet and e-marketing resources, implementing marketing research, increasing client retention, strengthening brand awareness for the organization or its products and services. There are no formal classes but consulting firm meetings to discuss client progress, methodological challenges and to review and rehearse client presentations and decisions regarding key client deliverables. While the methodologies and final deliverables are reviewed for quality purposes by the professor, the final deliverables are the responsibility of the consultants and are independently developed. Once selected for the course the students sign a contact outlining duties as well as personal learning and experiential objectives. The student will be evaluated by the professor on the same basis as a member of a professional services firm. Key performance attributes include technical skills such as analytical, writing and presentation skills as well as administration and project management effectiveness. Soft skills evaluated include engagement and contribution to the firm, leadership, team effectiveness/collaboration, professionalism and client relationships. Considerable emphasis is placed on the success of the client engagement as assessed by the professor through a formal client feedback and client satisfaction survey. Since this independent study is both project-and-client based, it is very rewarding, but demanding. Students will apply and improve skills related to delivery and management of professional services, and the integration of virtually all subject matter from previous courses. Students considering a career in consulting or professional service, with previous experience in managing projects, who enjoy interacting with business people, who thrive in fluid and ever-changing project cultures, who value the importance of fostering innovative or creative environments, are strongly encouraged to apply.\nAdmission to the course is by application and interview. Third and fourth year students may apply for the course in either the fall or winter term. While there are no formal course prerequisites, many projects do focus on issues such as consumer and promotional plans. Students should be interested in integrating skills, tools and concepts from numerous courses, and want a course where they apply themselves in the real-world management challenges.",
